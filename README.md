MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
How you thought about or interpreted the theme
The theme we decided to go with was that of a making the player want to reverse and replay the game to be able to achieve different endings/paths that cannot be acquired in just one playthrough. Not just replayablity in terms of gameplay being immersive but the fact that players to be able to fully understand the story and details of events going on need to reverse back to the beginning to attempt a different route in order to be able to understand the whole story. 

## Game Play
Objective
The monolith is a secret laboratory that was doing inhuman experiments on human test subjects, you the player take the role of a survivor aiming to escape the facility alive while dealing with obstacles along the way. 
## Impediments
Group communication was hard to stay on top of with many different ideas and plans being pitched about ultimately leading to development starting at a much later time significantly impeding the time had to develop a project. Having to go from a 2d survival game into a text based adventure. 
## Implementation
different paths and endings based on character choice allowing for replayablity.
